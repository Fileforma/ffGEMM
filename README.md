## What's this?
ffGEMM is a neural network training and inference library for **fast CPU matmuls over finite fields**!

We provide

✔ Arbitrary precision fixed-point arithmetic - Perform fast CPU matmuls with zero floating point ops.

✔ Safetensor support - Load formats stored as Safetensors.

✔ CPU finite field arithmetic library - Perform efficient finite field arithmetic on CPU. 


### Motivation
Everyone has access to a CPU and finite fields permit us perform a special kind of parallelization. We optimize for fast matmuls on the edge.

We wrote a detailed article [here.](https://fileforma.substack.com/p/update-ffgemm-finite-field-general?r=2at73k)


## Development Log
Sep 10th - Safetensors support added

Sep 16th - Whitepaper Substack launch

Sep 17th - Fixed point library added
